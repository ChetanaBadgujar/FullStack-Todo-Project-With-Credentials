## Project Name
# FullStack-Todo-Project-With-Credentials 
A full-stack MERN project is a web application that utilizes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. These technologies together provide the foundation for building robust and scalable web applications.

In a MERN project, MongoDB serves as the flexible and scalable database solution. Express.js, built on top of Node.js, simplifies the development of server-side logic and APIs. React.js, a popular JavaScript library, handles the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces. Node.js, a runtime environment, allows JavaScript code to be executed on the server-side.

The front-end of a MERN project is developed using React.js, which takes care of the user interface, data fetching, and user interactions. On the back-end, Express.js and Node.js handle business logic, database operations, and serve as the API layer for communication between the front-end and the database.

By leveraging the MERN stack, developers can create responsive and real-time web applications. The consistent use of JavaScript throughout the stack simplifies development, and the MERN ecosystem offers a wealth of resources and libraries for building and deploying applications.

In summary, a full-stack MERN project combines MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to create a comprehensive web application that efficiently manages data, server-side operations, and user interfaces.

## Overview
A full-stack MERN project is a web application that leverages MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to enable end-to-end development, from the back-end server to the front-end user interface. It offers a powerful and scalable solution for creating dynamic and responsive web applications with a consistent JavaScript-based technology stack.

## Installation
Clone the repository:


`git clone <repository_url>`
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone.

Change to the project directory:


`cd <project_directory>`
Navigate to the directory where the cloned repository is stored.

Install backend dependencies:


`cd backend`
`npm install`
This will install the necessary Node.js dependencies for the backend server.

Configure the backend:

Rename the .env.example file to .env.
Open the .env file and provide the required configuration values, such as database connection details or API keys.
Install frontend dependencies:

`cd ../frontend`
`npm install`
This will install the required Node.js dependencies for the frontend.

Configure the frontend:

If necessary, modify any configuration files specific to the frontend, such as API endpoint URLs.
Build the frontend (if applicable):


`npm run build`
This command creates an optimized production build of the frontend code.

Start the application:

`cd ../backend`
`npm start`
This command will start the backend server.

This command I have used in my VITE+REACT project
`npm run dev`

Access the application:
Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5713 to view the running MERN stack application.

Note: Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system before proceeding with the steps mentioned above.

## Usage
- A todo app helps in managing tasks and organizing daily life by creating lists of tasks and activities.
- It allows for prioritizing tasks, setting due dates, and categorizing tasks into different lists or categories.
- Reminders and notifications ensure timely completion of tasks and help in tracking progress.
- Collaboration features enable sharing task lists, assigning tasks to others, and tracking progress collectively.
- Additional features like notes, attachments, and customization options enhance task management and personalization.

## Acknowledgements
Gratitude is extended to the creators of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, the open source community, mentors, and users for their invaluable contributions to the development of this MERN stack todo app.
